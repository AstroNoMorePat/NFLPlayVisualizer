# NFLPlayVisualizer
A visualization script that illustrates pass plays from the 2020 NFL season.

Download the text files in this directory and you will be able to use PlotPassPlays.py to plot the routes from a radnomly selected pass play from last year's NFL season, complete with an approximate graphic representation of the offensive formation, location on the field, and in-game situation (score, time, etc).

Note that the diagrams produced by this script are based on general route descriptions provided in the data files above and are not based on tracking data.

This code is built on data provided by SIS that is publicly available here: https://github.com/SportsInfoSolutions/AnalyticsChallenge2021/tree/main/Data
